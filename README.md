## Problem

Youtube is soooo much useful with videos available for literally everything on the platform, but recent features such as shorts has made it one of the most distracting / addicting apps to have on your phone. Personally, whenever I open youtube to watch a video about something, I end up watching something else resulting in total time waste and 0 productivity. 

## Solution

Using youtubeâ€™s API, I want to build a website which will allow me to search for youtube videos and play them without distracting me by showing unnecessary shorts and unrelated youtube video thumbnails. Also, it would be an beneficial to have a watchlist feature. Additionally, I also want to enable google Adsense for this website.
